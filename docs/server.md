# LLMRix Router Server

This guide covers deploying the LLMRix Router as a Spring Boot service and calling its
OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.

## Requirements

- Java 17 or later; Java 21 is recommended.
- Maven 3.9 or later.
- Redis is optional and required only for shared multi-instance runtime state.

## Spring Boot Dependency

For an existing Spring Boot application, add the Router starter and a web runtime:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.llmrix.model</groupId>
  <artifactId>llmrix-model-router-spring-starter</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.3</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

The starter creates routed model beans, validates model targets at startup, and contributes health
and telemetry integration when the corresponding host libraries are present.

## Configuration

The HTTP API is disabled unless `llmrix.model.router.http.enabled=true`:

The server example provides one complete configuration template in
`application.yml.example`. It lists the full Router property surface, including route quota,
model limits and pricing, provider options, execution policy, observability, HTTP authentication,
and local or Redis state. Copy it to `application.yml` and provide the referenced environment
variables before starting the application.

```yaml
llmrix:
  model:
    router:
      default-route: general
      routes:
        general:
          strategy: balanced
          quota:
            requests-per-minute: 600

              operations: [chat]
              traits: [code, reasoning]
        openrouter:

          base-url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
          api-key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
          models:
            - name: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
              operations: [chat]
              features: [tools]
            - name: nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b:free
              operations: [embeddings]
            - name: nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2:free
              operations: [rerank]
```

`base-url` is configured once per integration and is shared by all models under that integration.
It may point to a proxy or private gateway. OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and Ollama are built in; additional
providers implement the `ModelProvider` SPI.

### JEV Semantic Routing

JEV is an optional semantic enhancement for existing Chat routes. It does not create a second model
pool and does not replace the configured route strategy. The Router first applies its normal
capability, health, quota, and concurrency filters, then passes the remaining candidates and their
user-defined `routing-tags` to a JEV decision client. The existing route strategy still selects the
final target and the existing executor still owns retry and fallback behavior.

Enable it only for explicitly selected routes:

```yaml
llmrix:
  model:
    router:
      decision:
        enabled: true
        provider: jev
        base-url: ${JEV_BASE_URL:https://api.typesafe.ai}
        api-key: ${JEV_API_KEY:}
        authenticator: bearer
        options: {}
        routes: [general, reasoning]
        timeout: 2s
        min-confidence: 0.70
        failure-mode: fallback
```

The model pool remains configured in the existing route declaration. Add semantic tags to models
that should be preferred for a given request type:

```yaml
integrations:
  deepseek:
    models:
      - name: deepseek-chat
        operations: [chat]
        features: [streaming, tools]
        traits: [code]
        metadata:
          routing-tags: "general,coding"
      - name: deepseek-reasoner
        operations: [chat]
        features: [streaming]
        traits: [reasoning, long-context]
        metadata:
          routing-tags: "reasoning,planning,coding"
```

`routing-tags` are user-defined semantic labels. The Router does not maintain a fixed global enum
or a separate `decision.intents` list. For each request, the union of tags on the currently eligible
route candidates is the JEV allow-list. JEV may return preferred tags and a confidence score, but it
may not introduce a tag outside that allow-list or select an arbitrary model ID. Tags are soft
preferences and cannot replace hard declarations such as `operations`, `features`, `traits`,
`input-modalities`, limits, health, or quota.

The standard integrations artifact includes a TypeSafe JEV provider. It calls `POST /v1/systemone`
with `Authorization: Bearer <decision.api-key>`, and defaults to `https://api.typesafe.ai`.
`decision.options.model` can override the default `jev-latest` model. The configuration fields
`decision.base-url`, `decision.api-key`, `decision.authenticator`, and `decision.options` are passed
to the configured decision provider. Applications can override the built-in implementation with:

- a `JevDecisionClient` Spring bean; or
- a `JevDecisionProvider` bean whose `id()` matches `decision.provider` (normally `jev`).

When JEV is enabled, the built-in provider is used unless an application supplies a matching custom
provider or client. Startup fails if a non-built-in provider is requested but no matching provider is
registered. When the client times out, fails, returns an invalid tag, or returns a confidence below
`min-confidence`, the Router uses the original route strategy.

Each integration contains a `models` list with explicit `name` and operation declarations. Routes
refer to models with explicit `integration` and `model` fields. `routes.<id>.models` is the complete
load-balancing pool; there is no separate fallback list.

Use `operations` for callable endpoints such as `chat`, `embeddings`, and `rerank`. Use `features`
for protocol behavior (`streaming`, `tools`, `structured-output`, and `prompt-cache`),
`input-modalities` for non-text chat input (`vision`, `video`, `audio`, and `file`), and `traits`
for model attributes (`code`, `reasoning`, and `long-context`). These sets are independent and are
validated separately against the provider adapter where applicable. Invalid declarations fail during
startup instead of being silently ignored.

Runtime adapter capabilities are exposed through `ModelTarget.providerCapabilities()` for provider-aware
validation. The `cache-aware` strategy keeps
requests with the same prompt-cache key on the same eligible target.

Routing hints are private to the Client-to-Router hop. Provider integrations do not receive the
`X-LLMRix-Routing-Hints` header by default. For a legacy upstream gateway that explicitly requires
this internal header, enable the compatibility switch on that integration:

```yaml
llmrix:
  model:
    router:
      integrations:
        openrouter:
          forward-routing-hints: true
```

`batch` is reserved for a future batch operation and is not currently supported by any built-in adapter.

Pricing supports input, output, cached-input, cache-write, and reasoning token rates. Usage settlement,
cost budgets, evaluation, and metrics account for those categories separately.

OpenAI exposes Chat, Embeddings, Audio, Images, and Videos. The shared OpenAI-compatible adapter can
also expose Rerank when the configured endpoint implements `POST /rerank`. Ollama exposes native Chat and Embeddings.
OpenRouter exposes Chat Completions, Embeddings, and Rerank through its unified API; the selected
upstream model must support the requested modality. DeepSeek currently exposes Chat. Native
transcription, speech, image-generation, and video-generation routes should use a provider that
implements the corresponding native endpoint.

### Shared Redis State

Use Redis when health, quota, and concurrency state must be shared across service instances:

```yaml
llmrix:
  model:
    router:
      state:
        mode: redis
        redis:
          uri: redis://localhost:6379/0
          key-prefix: llmrix:model:router
          lease-ttl: 2m
          quota-window: 1m
```

Redis mode is fail-closed. An invalid configuration or unavailable store does not silently downgrade
global limits to JVM-local limits.

Local quota partitions use a bounded Caffeine registry. `max-quota-partitions` rejects new dynamic
quota keys once the limit is reached; it does not evict active partitions and accidentally reset
their counters. `quota-idle-timeout` must be at least one minute so an idle partition cannot be
recreated inside the default quota window. Use Redis for quota state shared across instances.

### Video Generation Route

Video generation requires a dedicated route and a provider model with the `video-generation` operation:

```yaml
llmrix:
  model:
    router:
      routes:
        video:
          strategy: priority
          models:
            - integration: openai
              model: sora
      integrations:
        openai:
          provider: openai
          base-url: https://api.openai.com/v1
          api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
          models:
            - name: sora
              operations: [video-generation]
```

## Standalone Example

The runnable server example is in `llmrix-model-router-server-examples`:

```bash
mvn -pl :llmrix-model-router-server-examples -am package -DskipTests
java -jar llmrix-model-examples/llmrix-model-router-server-examples/target/llmrix-model-router-server-examples-1.0.3-exec.jar
```

The default port is `8080`. `API_KEY` is the Bearer key for the Router HTTP API and must match
`llmrix.model.router.http.auth.bootstrap-key`; it is not a provider key:

```bash
export API_KEY=your-llmrix-http-key

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}"

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "general",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself"}],
    "temperature": 0
  }'
```

The request `model` is a route name such as `general`, `reasoning`, or `code`, not an underlying
provider model ID.

Embedding and Rerank routes can be called with the same Router Bearer key:

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/embeddings' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"model":"embeddings","input":"Text to embed"}'

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/rerank' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"model":"rerank","query":"refund policy","documents":["Refunds are available within 30 days.","Contact support by email."],"top_n":1}'
```

## HTTP API

See [api.md](api.md) for protocol structures, status codes, successful responses, and error formats.

| Endpoint | Support |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Synchronous and SSE streaming chat completions. |
| `POST /v1/responses` | Core Responses API subset, with JSON and SSE streaming responses. |
| `POST /v1/embeddings` | Text or token-array embeddings with `float` and `base64` encoding. |
| `POST /v1/rerank` | Cohere/Jina-compatible query/document reranking. |
| `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` | Multipart audio transcription. |
| `POST /v1/audio/translations` | Multipart audio translation. |
| `POST /v1/audio/speech` | Text-to-speech with a binary audio response. |
| `POST /v1/images/generations` | Image generation. |
| `POST /v1/images/edits` | Multipart image editing. |
| `POST /v1/videos` | Create a video generation task. |
| `GET /v1/videos/{video_id}` | Retrieve video task status. |
| `GET /v1/videos/{video_id}/content` | Download completed video content. |
| `DELETE /v1/videos/{video_id}` | Delete a video task. |
| `POST /v1/videos/{video_id}/remix` | Create a remix task. |
| `GET /v1/models` | Available chat route identifiers. Operation-only routes are selected by their endpoint. |

The server example includes free OpenRouter targets for both retrieval operations:

- Embeddings: `liquid/lfm-2.5-embedding-350m:free`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-embed-1b:free`, and
  `nvidia/llama-nemotron-embed-vl-1b-v2:free`.
- Rerank: `nvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-vl-1b-v2:free` and `qwen/qwen3-reranker-8b`.

The `model` value sent to the Router HTTP API is the route name (`embeddings` or `rerank`), not the
upstream OpenRouter model ID. The upstream model IDs are selected inside the route configuration.

Authentication defaults to `api-key`; use `mode: none` only in a trusted network. The starter accepts
opaque Bearer keys through `ApiKeyVerifier`, propagates or generates `X-Request-Id`, and emits
OpenAI-shaped errors. It does not issue keys, manage tenants, or store secrets.

### Video Task

The default standalone example does not enable a video route. Configure a `video` route as shown in
the Video Generation Route section before using the following commands.

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/videos' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "video",
    "prompt": "A calm ocean scene at sunset",
    "seconds": "8",
    "size": "1280x720"
  }'
```

Use the returned `id` to retrieve or download the task:

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/videos/{video_id}?model=video' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}"

curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/videos/{video_id}/content?model=video' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --output output.mp4
```

### Video Understanding

Video understanding uses a Chat Completions `video_url` content part with a configured multimodal
route:

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "multimodal",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this video and describe its scenes."},
        {"type": "video_url", "video_url": {
          "url": "https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4"
        }}
      ]
    }]
  }'
```

`video_url` accepts a public URL or a `data:video/mp4;base64,...` URL. URL support depends on the
selected upstream model. `/v1/videos` remains the video-generation lifecycle API.

### Document Understanding

Document and PDF understanding uses a Chat Completions `file` content part. The route must declare
`input-modalities: [file]`:

```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "model": "documents",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize the main points of this PDF."},
        {"type": "file", "file": {
          "filename": "report.pdf",
          "file_url": "https://example.com/report.pdf"
        }}
      ]
    }]
  }'
```

Use `file_url` for a public file, `file_data` with a Base64 Data URL, or an uploaded `file_id`.
Availability depends on the selected provider and model file input protocol.
